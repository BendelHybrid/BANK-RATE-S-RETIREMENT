-------
# Problem Objective: Analyze Bank Rate's best and worst states for retirement dataset for 2022 and give recommendations based off my report.



------
# Data Sourcing: Data was sourced from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/download?datasetVersionNumber=1](https://bankrate.infogram.com/best-and-worst-states-for-retirees-ranking-table-1hd12yxwn0rlw6k)



--------
# Data Transformation: The data was tranformed using Power Query Editor and visualised with Power Bi.


-------
# Findings and Recommendation:
While analyzing bankrate's best and worst states for retirement in Power Bi, I found out the following:
1. Mississippi had the highest sum of well being while Massachusetts had the least.
2. Alaska had a rank of 50 as compared to Georgia which had only two.
3. New Mexico had the highest crime rate while new Hampshire had the lowest.
4. Hawaii is the most affordable of all states unlined Tennessee.
5. Maryland had a higher culture and diversity scoreline as compared to Kentucky which had the list.
Based off this, my recommendations are:

Consider Mississippi for Retirement: Mississippi ranked highest in terms of well-being. This indicates that it may offer a favorable environment for retirees. Further research into specific factors contributing to well-being in Mississippi during my analysis supports this.

Safety Considerations: New Hampshire had the lowest crime rate, making it an attractive option for retirees concerned about safety. Conversely, New Mexico had the highest crime rate, which could raise concerns for retirees seeking a secure environment. Safety should be an important factor to consider when deciding on a retirement location.

Affordability and Quality of Life: Hawaii was noted as the most affordable state, except for Tennessee. This implies that Hawaii may provide good value for retirees in terms of cost of living. Exploring the specific affordability factors in Hawaii can help identify its attractiveness as a retirement destination. Additionally, considering states like Tennessee, which are affordable and offer a high quality of life, can provide alternative options for retirees.

Cultural and Diversity Considerations: Maryland had a higher culture and diversity score compared to Kentucky, which ranked lower. Retirees who value cultural vibrancy and diversity may find Maryland more appealing. Understanding the specific cultural and diversity factors contributing to Maryland's higher score can assist in determining its suitability as a retirement location.

These recommendations are based on the specific findings from the analysis. It is worthy to note though that consideration of personal preferences, financial considerations, and individual retirement goals are essential when making a decision about retirement destinations.
